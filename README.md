## Settings
Explosions - ship reactor, meteors/falling chunks, and a "bigger explosion."

Environment - sand funnel, island fling, "large ship" events, and fishies.

Ship - Hearthian and Nomai ship shakes.

Player - general player shakes.

Scout - shake from firing scout.

Jetpack Boost - off by default, as is too much shaking and makes other shakes not stand out. But you can turn it up if you want to vomit.

## For Other Modders
To add camera shakes to your own mod, copy the [ICameraShaker](https://github.com/MegaPiggy/SBtT.CameraShake/tree/main/CameraShake) script to your mod project.
It contains functions for different types of shakes, and properties to access the values for the settings above.
