## Camera Shake
This mod adds some camera shakage to various parts of the game.
(Can also be used by other mods to add their own camera shakes?)

## Settings
Explosions - ship reactor, meteors/falling chunks, and a "bigger explosion."
Environment - sand funnel, island fling, the "large ship," and fishies.
Ship - Hearthian and Nomai ship shakes.
Player - general player shakes.
Scout - shake from firing scout.

Jetpack Boost - off by default, as is too much shaking and makes other shakes not stand out. But you can turn it up if you want to vomit.
